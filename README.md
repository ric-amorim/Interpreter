# Interpreter in C++

## Current state of the project

  Interpreter fully functional but I want to add more data types, because right
  now the interpreter only has support for integers and booleans data types.

## Description and Acknowledgments

   Interpreter in c++ made with the help of the book Writing an interpreter in Go by Thorsten Ball. It's an interpreter for Monkey programming language (Itâ€™s a language specifically
designed for this book). <br />
